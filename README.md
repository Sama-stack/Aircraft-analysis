# Technical Anlysis of the Aircraft Accidents
## Overview
This project analyzes and identifies the lowest-risk aircraft options for the company’s entry into the aviation industry to diversify its portfolio.

## Business Problem
They are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft.
Determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. Translate the findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

## Data
This dataset is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

## Methods
 This project deals with missing values, how to aggregate the data, and how to visualize it in an interactive dashboard.

## Results

The mean fatal injuries was 0.65. 
Therefore, most accidents have few or no fatalities at all.

The mode for the aircraft make showed that Cessna is the most frequently involved in accidents

The mode of the weather condition gave the result that VMC is the most common weather condition during aircraft accidents.

## Recommendations
Aircraft Selection: The company should focus on aircraft types with lower accident frequencies. Based on the analysis, Cessna has the highest number of accidents, therefore, alternative, safer options should be considered.

Weather Considerations: Although accidents occur under VMC conditions, it’s essential to ensure pilots are trained for low-visibility scenarios to reduce risks associated with different weather conditions.

Data-Driven Decisions: Continue tracking and analyzing accident data regularly to update safety measures and aircraft selection![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b69c2d8-8bcd-4c08-bd78-c2d249b32327)

 # Next steps
Further Analysis: Investigate additional features like engine type, pilot experience, and flight purpose to further refine safety recommendations![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fafc0fe8-bb52-4a2b-b9e0-3fb89af9dca8)
